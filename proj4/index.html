<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p> In this project, we build a cloth simulator that responds to forces and other objects in real time. 
    To represent the cloth, we approximated it as an array of point masses connected by various types of springs. Then 
    we just had to simulate the motion of the point masses and springs to arrive at our first simulation of the cloth.
    To compute and display the motion of the cloth, we used Verlet integration to determine the effects of the forces
    in the scene on each point mass in our cloth. We also implemented functionality that handles collisions with other
    objects, specifically spheres and planes. To do this, we just alter the position of any point mass that enters or
    crosses this other object so that it is correct. This extended into implementing self-collisions, when point masses
    within the cloth collide with themselves. Finally, we implemented shaders using GLSL. With this new technique for
    defining fragments, we implemented diffuse and Blinn-Phong shading from lecture, and then expanded it to texture
    mapping, displacement/bump mapping, and environment-mapped reflections.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>

<p> For part 1, we implemented build_grid in cloth.cpp. This function serves to create a grid of point masses and springs
    that represent the initial cloth. We did this by first creating num_width_points * num_height_points point masses,
    spaced evenly across our cloth's width and height. We stored these values in the provided point_masses attribute of
    the Cloth struct in row-major order. Then, we created springs of three different types to connect these point masses.
    Structural springs connect a point mass to the point masses directly to the left and above it, shearing constraints
    connect a point mass to its top left and top right, and bending constraints connect a point mass to the mass two above
    it and the one two to the left. While we were implementing this part, it was important to make sure that we considered
    all edge cases so that we did not ever attempt to access memory out of bounds. Finally, we store each spring into
    the corresponding attribute of the cloth struct, in arbitrary order.</p>

    <p>
        One issue we ran into was that when we were looping over our point masses to add our springs was we were creating a
    new pointer to the point mass in local memory, and then trying to use that pointer address to create the spring.
    This would result in us creating springs with the wrong addresses for point masses, and lead to a segfault.
    We fixed this by directly getting the address of the pointer in the array instead of creating a temporary variable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The image below shows the generated grid with all constraints enabled.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">

        </table>
    </div>

    <p>
        Now the images below show the same grid, but first with no shearing springs, and then with just shearing springs.
        Notice that you can see the springs that take care of the diagonal constraints. The shearing constraint takes care
        of diagonal connections.

            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
    <p>
        For part 2, we integrated motion equations to apply forces to the point masses in our cloth. We did this by
        implementing simulate in cloth.cpp. To do this, we first summed the total external forces applied by looping
        over all the external accelerations and multiplying them by mass. Next, we set the forces of every point mass in
        our cloth equal to the total_external_force we just calculated. Next, we used Verlet integration as presented in
        the spec to update the position of each point mass given the parameters and the previous position of the mass.
        Finally, we constrained the changes so that the springs do not change too much in any one time step. If the
        distance between any two connected point masses was determined to be too large, each of them was moved
        towards each other if they were both unpinned. If they were not both unpinned, only the unpinned point mass was
        moved.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image below shows the cloth resulting from this implementation. One image has 2 pinned points while the other
        one has 4 pinned points.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="writeup-photos/task2/pinned2.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">2 points pinned.</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="writeup-photos/task2/pinned4.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">4 points pinned.</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>
        Let's consider what happens to the simulation when we alter some of the parameters in this calculation. When we
        decrease the spring constant, we see the cloth has less structural integrity, more visible ripples, and looks
        like a lighter piece of fabric. With an increased spring constant, there is much more structural integrity, no
        visible vertical ripples, and less movement overall because the springs are moving much less. It looks like a heavy
        fabric. When we increase the density, the cloth folds over itself more easily, with lots of movement within the cloth.
        Lowering the density does the opposite, resulting in a flat cloth. Finally, higher damping value makes the cloth
        come to rest much faster, while lower damping values results in the cloth swinging back and forth much more before
        coming to rest.
    </p>

<h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling Collisions with other objects</h2>
    <p>
        For part 3, we handled the cloth's collisions with spheres and planes. To do this, we implemented both Sphere::collide
        and Plane::collide. Both functions take in a point mass and adjust its position if it is inside the sphere or passes
        through the plane. To do this we just had to do a little vector arithmetic for the point-in-sphere and point crossed
        plane tests, and then follow the spec on how to adjust the position of the point mass if it did collide. At first,
        our point-in-plane collision didn't work as expected, but we fixed it by double checking our vector math to fix
        the new position of the point mass.
    </p>
    <p>
        One bug we encountered was that the cloth slid across the plane after landing on it. This was because we were adding
        the SURFACE_OFFSET variable direectly, but what we actually needed to do was add SURFACE_OFFSET * normal. This fix
        stopped the cloth from sliding off the plane in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below are examples of the cloth colliding with a sphere as well as resting on a plane.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="writeup-photos/task3/sphere_ks_5000.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">cloth on sphere.</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="writeup-photos/task3/plane_resting.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">cloth on plane.</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>
        We can also look at how the ks spring constant changes the look of the cloth when it collides with the object.
        Below are examples of ks = 500, 5000, and 50000 respectively.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="writeup-photos/task3/sphere_ks_500.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">ks = 500</figcaption>
                </td>

                    <img src="writeup-photos/task3/sphere_ks_5000.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">ks = 5,000</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="writeup-photos/task3/sphere_ks_50000.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">ks = 50,000</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>
        The higher the spring constant value, the more strong the springs are, meaning the cloth has less motion and is
        more rigid overall. The cloth with ks = 500 is very thin-looking and drapes easily over the sphere. With ks = 50000,
        the cloth looks thicker and drapes less smoothly over the sphere.
    </p>

<h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling self-collisions</h2>
    <p>
        To implement self-collisions in part 4, we use spatial hashing to group each point mass into a bin with point
        masses we determine to be "close" to it. Then, in cloth::self_collide, we can take a point mass and use the
        populated hash_table to determine which other point masses it is close to. We can loop over these
        "potential collisions" and determine if they are within a certain distance apart. If they're what we define to
        be too close, we can correct the location of these point masses to move them further apart.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can once again vary the values of the parameters when viewing this test in the GUI to determine how they alter
        the final product. Like before, increasing the density causes the cloth to have more folds and ripples, while
        decreasing the density does the opposite. Also, increasing the spring constant makes the cloth fold over itself
        less and there are fewer visible waves in the cloth itself. Decreasing the spring constant has the opposite effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sets of images below show the cloth falling on itself with different density values. density values used are
        1.5, 15, and 150.

        Notice that with density of 1.5, the cloth is far smoother. The folds of the cloth are stiffer, and it has more
        structure. As the density gets bigger, the cloth has more wrinkles in it and produces more folds.
    </p>

<h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>
    <p>
        For part 5, we pivot to writing GLSL shaders. We work with both vertex and fragment shaders, but most of the code
        we write is for fragment shaders. The output of the vertex shader is used as the input to the fragment shaders
        we write. First, we wrote a simple fragment shader for diffuse lighting. We simply take our inputs, follow the
        formula from lecture, and output. One hurdle we ran into here was determining what values to use for our parameter
        kd, and later in part 5, what values to use for other hyperparameters. At the end of the day, we ended up achieving
        the results we wanted by tinkering with different combinations of these hyperparameters until we got some that
        resulted in the outputs we wanted. Another thing we had to think about while debugging our output for task 1 was
        normalizing vectors. In order to get our output to match what we saw on the spec, we realized we had to normalize
        the normal vector that we were using. We also fixed a bug by realizing we can quickly get the magnitude of any
        vector var in GLSL by using the built-in length function.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">

    <p>
        For part 5 task 2, we implemented Blinn-Phong shading. This was an extension of task 1, and we implemented it
        following the equation presented in lecture. We had to test what hyperparameters worked best, and once again
        we normalized our normal vectors (and a couple others) to get the exact results we wanted. For the specular light
        component, we realized what effect increasing and decreasing p and h had, and we were able to use that to get the
        specular lighting to look exactly how we wanted.

        To better illustrate the implementation of Blinn-Phong shading, we can take a look at each individual component.
        There's the specular, ambinet, and diffuse component, and putting those all together creates the glint effect
        we desire.

        Task 4 involved implementing a bumpy texture. We followed the equations in the spec pretty closely. First we
        created the tangent-bitangent-normal matrix (TBN matrix). We also created a function h(u,v) that returns the height
        encoded by a height map. When we input certain coordinates, we get the height that we want that part to be at. Using
        this h function, we're able to find the change in u and v and create our local space normal. Using this normal and
        the TBN matrix, we can find the normal of the displaced model space. After implementing this, we can see the bumps
        on the sphere.

        The next part of task 4 was displacement mapping. This allowed the bumps to actually change the
        motion of the cloth and be impacted more by the bumps. To do this, we had to edit the Displacement.vert
        file to slightly change the vertex positions. We used the equation in the spec to find new p values which
        edits the position of the points on the image. The cloth has a more textured look as a result.

        We can see the bump and displacement with different resolutions. The first set of images has 16x16 resolution, and
        the second set has 128x128 resolution.

        the higher resolution images have more clear patterns and look smoother and sharper.

        Task 5 was similar to task 3, but instead of sampling from the image texture, we determined what the reflected eye
        ray was and then sampled from the appropriate texture.
